My Notes:
I found and took my inspriation from the Lambdaschool.com page as well as the training kit. Using a color picker extension I was able to extract the colors from the lambda website to use within my own design. Images were also extracted from the website and from a free stockphoto page Pixabay.com.

The idea behind my design is to keep it simple. Helpdesks should be functional and practical first, but good design should still exist. I spent hours researching other helpdesks and not many are "modern". I have taken my path on this attempting to keep a clean but usable healpdesk.
